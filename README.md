**Genetic Programming (GP)** is a technique in the field of artificial intelligence that allows programs to **evolve**. It starts with an initial population of **unfit** (usually randomly generated) programs and gradually adapts them to perform a specific task. This adaptation process involves applying operations analogous to natural genetic processes to the program population.

Here are some key points about genetic programming:

**Analogy to Biological Evolution**: Genetic programming mimics the principles of biological evolution. Initially, unfit programs are evolved using principles such as **mutation**, **crossover**, and **selection**.

**Objective**: The main goal of genetic programming is to create programs that can efficiently solve a particular task. These programs are improved through genetic operations based on a predefined fitness measure related to the desired task.

**Process**:

- **Initialization**: A population of randomly generated programs is created.
- **Selection**: Programs with better performance are preferentially chosen for reproduction (crossover).
- **Recombination (Crossover)**: Selected parts of programs (parents) are combined to produce new offspring.
- **Mutation**: Random changes are introduced into the programs.
- **Evaluation**: Program performance is measured using a fitness function.
- The process is iteratively repeated, with each new generation typically having better fitness than the previous one.

**Applications**:

- **Optimization**: Genetic programming is commonly used for solving optimization problems in engineering, finance, and robotics.
- **Automatic Program Generation**: GP can automatically create programs for specific tasks without manual coding by developers.

**Related Algorithms**: Genetic programming is closely related to other evolutionary algorithms like **genetic algorithms** and **evolution strategies**, which share similar principles but differ in the representation of solutions and the operators used.
